# audio-emotion-classification
In this project we classify negative audio emotions , data is combined between ( RAVDESS/ SAVEE/TESS and CREMA-D) 

After extracting features we perform PCA to reduce dimensions)

4 models were tested : CNN, LSTM, KNN and SVM 

Best results were obtained with SVM 

You can find the pretrained model in file 'finalized_model.sav' ( SVM version)
